### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?

A Json Web Token 

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?

The part of the token that validates it crytographically

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?

Yes

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.

Have the JWT stored in as a header and allow it to be deciphered to get account information

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?

A mock is a made up example of a way a real function might behave (for instance, if you need to test that a function gives back half of a random number, the mock might always throw the random number as x)

- What is continuous integration?

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?

It returns particular information from what you've interacted with and can also rename that information. A good usage is to return "num_employees" AS "numEmployees"

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?

I generally much preferred flask and python because they are so much more streamlined and simple than JS. I will say, it does seem to me that express and js are more powerful and functional for web-dev
